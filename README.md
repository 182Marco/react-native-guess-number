# 🎯 Guess Number App

Welcome to **Guess Number**, a simple yet functional mobile game built with **React Native**. This project represents my **second learning playground** after developing a basic **To-Do App**, and it focuses primarily on exploring the core features and capabilities of React Native.

## 📱 About the App

The game itself is intentionally **basic**—the user tries to guess a number chosen by the app. While the gameplay is minimal, the project serves as a **technical exploration** rather than a polished product.

> ⚠️ The UI is intentionally rough and minimalistic, as the main goal was to dive deep into the framework's features rather than design.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Despite its simplicity, the app is built with **clean and scalable code architecture** in mind:

- 🧩 **Modular Components**: Each component is split into separate files for:
  - Logic
  - TypeScript models
  - Templates (JSX)
  - Styles
  - Utility functions

- 🧱 **Enum Usage**: All static variables used in the logic are grouped into `enum` structures to avoid typos and follow best practices.

- 🧼 **Clean Code Standards**: I take pride in maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase. This structure is not only ideal for learning but also **translatable to enterprise-level development**, where:
  - Maintenance becomes faster
  - Scalability is easier
  - Costs are reduced
  - Revenue potential is maximized

- 🧠 **Pragmatic Destructuring**: Destructuring is used **only when it helps reduce code verbosity**, not as a stylistic choice. I avoid destructuring dozens of properties from an object just for the sake of it, especially when it leads to code duplication or reduced clarity.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- React Native
- TypeScript
- Custom styling (no UI libraries)
- Functional components and hooks
